list of things to fix up
------------------------

- make error reporting better for when filters are malformed for the features they're filtering (currently an assertion just fails)
- allow for the scraping of specific packages (should be easy)
- ADD TESTS
- put cl flags in config file for dcpp_extract
- add `operator==` to `FeatureData` so that dcpp_equals is actually correct (and then change == for `FeatureMap`)
